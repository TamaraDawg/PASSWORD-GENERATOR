##PASSWORD GENERATOR. 

I have created a password generator for when a new, secure password is needed:
When the button 'Generate Password' is clicked, there is a series of prompts which pop up for the password criteria. When user either confirms or denies what to include in the password, it applies to the generated password. The user can decide the length of the password and whether or not it includes lowercase, uppercase, numeric and/or special characters. The password length is generated to be at least 8 characters or no more than 128 characters. When all prompts are answered by the user, a password is generated which fits all requested attributes. The password is generated, written to the page.
